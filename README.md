# Data-Science-Parkinson-s-Disease-Project

## 🧠 Parkinson’s Disease Prediction  
This project leverages Machine Learning to detect Parkinson’s disease using patient data. Analyzing key biomedical voice measurements helps in early diagnosis and medical decision-making.  

### 🔹 Key Features: 
✅ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering for better model performance  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature importance 📊  
✅ Trained models using Logistic Regression & Random Forest Classifier  
✅ Performance evaluation with Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report  

### 🛠 Tech Stack:  
🔹 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
🔹 Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)  
🔹 Classification Algorithms for disease prediction  

### 📌 How It Works:  
1️⃣ Load and preprocess patient data 📄  
2️⃣ Perform EDA & Feature Selection 🔍  
3️⃣ Train & evaluate ML models for accurate classification 📈  
4️⃣ Predict Parkinson’s disease based on key biomedical markers 🩺
